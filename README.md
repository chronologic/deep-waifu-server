## üîß Environment variables

This repo uses [`dotenv`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) to load environment variables.

For development, an `.env` file should be created based on the `.env.example` template file. The `.env` file should never be commited.

In production, environment variables can be injected directly.

Below is a list of possible environment variables.
